Ever since I was introduced to music like [Imogen Heap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHk2lLaDzlM), [Bon Iver](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaYgMdq6NDg), and in particular [Jacob Collier's famous "Harmonizer"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXIApugIuqk), I became obsessed with finding a way to replicate the sound of this incredible instrument, the vocal harmonizer.
 
Commercial plugins offering this effect [do exist](http://www.izotope.com/en/products/nectar/features/harmony.html), but most are limited to four harmony voices, come with a hefty price tag, and are clunky & difficult to use in actual live performance. The closest thing to Jacob Collier's Harmonizer currently available on the market seems to be [Antares Harmony Engine](http://www.antarestech.com/product/harmony-engine/), which retails for $249 and only has four harmony voices. ([Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hgeVqTNVIw) what it sounds like.)

As far as I know, there is no piece of software currently commercially available that offers the features of Jacob Collier's Harmonizer: 16 real-time, incredibly human-sounding harmony voices. 

So I decided to create it myself.
